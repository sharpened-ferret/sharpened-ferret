# Hello world!

Hi, I'm a final year Computer Science MSci student at Swansea university. I'm currently finishing up my degree, working on some hobby projects, and looking for work.

## Current Projects: 
- [RecipeViewer v2](https://github.com/sharpened-ferret/RecipeViewer) - an update to my python webapp for managing my personal recipe book
- ExifGUI - a flutter-based graphical front-end for [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/), as part of my 4th year dissertation. 
- Learning Docker and reverse proxies - for running various cool federated services on my Debian home server. 
- Some misc. game dev projects with friends.
